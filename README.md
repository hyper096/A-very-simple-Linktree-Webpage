# A very simple Linktree Webpage

## What is this?

This is a very simple linktree webpage, as the title specifies. It is based on my personal website, which you can find in this post.

## Can I use it myself?

Yes, anyone can use this code. You can costumize it, modify it, do anything with it! Go crazy! Also if you want, you can show me the linktree page you have created with this code by contacting me. By the way, don't forget to replace certain values. Some comments should be added to the code soon.  
PS: No need to credit me.

## Will it be updated?

Probably it will be, but not frequently. I will see in the future. Untill then, use the latest files!

## Did you build it yourself?

Mostly yes, but I got inspired from a few youtube tutorials and I took a bit of code from there. Don't judge me, it's my first project which I'm uploading here.

## But what if I want to contribute?

If you want to contribute, contact me on one of my social media's. We will discuss it there, and I will decide if you can or cannot.
